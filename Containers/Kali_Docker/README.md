  <b>NOTE: These containers are built to be disposed as soon as you exit the container or close the session with the container</b><br>
  In order to keep these containers for long term purposes please view the corresponding shell script and modify the following:<br> 
  In the <code>docker run</code> command remove the <code>--rm</code> option<br>
  I would also recommend creating and mounting a volume for the container
